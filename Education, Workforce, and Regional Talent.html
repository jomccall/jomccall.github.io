                        <p>
                          The Middle Tennessee workforce is the regional population that is working or actively searching for work.
                          At different points in time, various dynamics in our national and local economies have elevated the search
                          and preparation of the workforce for high demand jobs to different levels. We are currently at a boiling point.
                          The economic conditions that brought us here are described well in this study conducted for the Northern Middle
                          Tennessee Workforce Board by the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce in 2020:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class = "blockquote">
                        <p>
                          “In 2007 and again in 2010, the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness (CREC) completed studies of labor
                          market opportunities for the Nashville area. During this period, the annual unemployment rate went from a low
                          of 5.2% in the Clarksville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to a height of 10.3%, while the Nashville MSA
                          reached a peak of 9.5% from a low of 4.1%.1 These studies guided regional economic and workforce development
                          efforts, and educational investments, for several years. In 2015, The Research Center of the Nashville Area
                          Chamber of Commerce (Chamber) conducted an updated study that provided data and analysis of industry and
                          occupational sectors driving the region’s jobs growth and prosperity offering insights into Nashville’s demand
                          for workforce supply and identifying skills gaps that posed challenges for future industry growth and development.
                          In 2019, unemployment in the Nashville MSA was trending towards historic lows with some counties dipping below 2.0%,
                          while the nearby Clarksville MSA hovered near 4.0%.2 The economy was at full employment, meaning no workers who are
                          able and willing are involuntarily unemployed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Meanwhile, the economy (as measured in terms of Gross Domestic Product [GDP]) for both regions continued to grow at
                          a compound annual rate of 3.5% (Clarksville MSA) and 6.1% (Nashville MSA) with jobs for all industries growing at a
                          rate of approximately 3.3% per year.3 The tight labor market, coupled with extraordinary economic growth, did not seem
                          inclined to slow down. This elevated workforce to the region’s top issue, driving policy makers to consider what was
                          needed to develop the talent base, recruit new workforce to the region, and increase workforce participation among Middle
                          Tennesseans through training programs and workforce initiatives. Understanding labor force participation and who remains
                          on the sidelines means consideration of innovations in outreach, training, recruitment practices, and public and private
                          sector policies. Alignment of these systems supports equitable participation in the prosperity of the region.”

                          To paraphrase this excerpt, the unemployment rate was low, workers had choices, and economists call this a tight labor market.
                          This elevated the conversation about intentional workforce development, bringing new pilot programs and public private
                          partnerships online, bringing grant funding into the region, spurring the creation of internal upskilling programs at
                          various companies, and increasing the work already being done by workforce development professionals of all stripes.
                          Many see this set of conditions as an opportunity to examine opportunities to bring equity into the conversation by targeting
                          those who have been left on the sidelines of our regional economy for pipelines to jobs with family sustaining wages and
                          upward mobility.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Today, the landscape is both similar and different in key ways. A global pandemic came on strong in the region in Spring of 2020.
                          Businesses shut down, people stayed home, and the region saw a tragic death toll of (). Even now, in Autumn of 2021, many
                          industries are operating at diminished capacities, with distancing and other safety measures still in place, or remotely.
                          Layoffs (figures?), raises were put on hold, . What remains the same as the outlook did in early 2020 is the region’s critical
                          need for talent. Manufacturing centers are short, restaurants are understaffed, marketing positions are sitting open for months,
                          while the dynamics and reasons between industries may differ, the need is omnipresent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This page looks at this need from a few different angles. In the data driven segment the educational ecosystem of the region is
                          examined first, followed by a profile of the area workforce. In the following segment segment some of the work of other
                          organizations are highlighted as examples about what is being done to bridge this gap. This includes work by other researchers,
                          private and public educational institutions, workforce development professionals, workforce boards, foundations and community
                          groups focused on connecting people to good jobs, local governments, private companies, trade groups and unions, and so many more.
                        </p>

                        <p>This discussion also leads in to the analysis that is done on a couple of other pages, specifically regarding industry and occupation.
                          What (link) industries are growing? What industries may not have high rates of growth but compose large portions or regional employment?
                          What are the strong suits of each county in the region in question? Then, (link) what industries and occupations provide dignified
                          employment for workers; where can you find wage growth, wrap around services like childcare and healthcare benefits? What industries
                          and occupations employ diversely, and which do not? Both of these perspectives are equally as important when we are examining blah blah
                          blah.
                        </p>

                        <p>On this page we’re looking not only at what educators and training are doing for the workforce, but also at who makes up the workforce.
                          Is participation representative of the area’s population? Does a substantial portion of the workforce have an educational attainment
                          associated with living wages?
                        </p>

                        <p>The role of this page is to guide you in and around available data that is helpful in assessing the health of the local talent and workforce
                          ecosystem, and direct you to resources that can help enhance understanding and answer your needs.

                          Our highlights are broken into three big-picture areas: educational attainment, educational awards, and a workforce demographic profile.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <strong>Educational Attainment</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          A natural place to begin is by exploring the educational attainment of an area. This data is often obtained from the US Census Bureau
                          surveys and that is what we use here. The most reliable data is from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates – representing an
                          average over a period of 5 years. This is a good way to examine prevailing trends in an area; almost as if educational attainment is
                          being examined as a demographic feature. The use of 5-year estimates also allows us to use the strength of data collected over 5 years
                          to surpass the weakness of a small geographical sample size, for example, that of a block group. The ACS 5 Year estimates collect
                          information about the following levels of attainment:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Less than 9th Grade</li>
                            <li>9th to 12th Grade, No Degree</li>
                            <li>High School Degree or Equivalent (meaning a GED)</li>
                            <li>Associates Degree</li>
                            <li>Some College No Degree</li>
                            <li>Bachelor’s Degree</li>
                            <li>Graduate Degree</li>
                          </ul>
                          Each of these are associated with different levels of earnings, because they qualify individuals for different types of jobs.
                          The visualization below gives a quick glimpse at the associated earnings in the State of Tennessee from the Census Bureau’s ACS 5 Year Estimates:

                          We can see clearly that during the period ranging between 2015 and 2019 Williamson, Davidson, and then Knox Counties have the highest percent of population
                          with this high level of educational attainment. Note that this is normalized by population so we are not simply seeing the reflection of their relatively
                          large populations. We do see a lot of red here so although you are able to see all levels in the tooltip, we can flip the visualization to display
                          the percent of population with less than a high school education:

                          Educational attainment data is collected by the US Census Bureau through both their decennial census and their Current Population Survey.
                          Individuals are asked “What is the highest grade of school ___ has completed, or the highest degree ___ has received?”
                          The question has been incorporated into the Current Population Survey and the Census since 1940, and has been asked the same way as it
                          is today since 1992.
